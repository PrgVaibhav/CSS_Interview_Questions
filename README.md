> We will cover a variety of CSS questions ranging from basic to advanced. Let's get started!

## Question 1: What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements are to be displayed, including layout, colors, fonts, and animations.

## Question 2: What is the difference between padding and margin in CSS?

Padding refers to the space between an element's content and its border, while margin refers to the space between an element's border and the adjacent elements or the edge of the container. Padding is used to create space within an element, while margin is used to create space around an element.

## Question 3: What are the different ways to include CSS in a web page?

There are three ways to include CSS in a web page:

-   Inline CSS: CSS is included in the HTML tag using the "style" attribute.
-   Internal CSS: CSS is included in the head section of an HTML document using the "style" tag.
-   External CSS: CSS is included in a separate file and linked to the HTML document using the "link" tag.

## Question 4: What is the box model in CSS?

The box model is a CSS concept that describes how elements are displayed on a web page. Every element on a web page is considered a rectangular box with content, padding, borders, and margins. The box model specifies how these elements are sized and positioned in relation to each other.

## Question 5: What is the difference between class and ID in CSS?

A class is a selector used to apply a style to a group of elements, while an ID is a selector used to apply a style to a single element. IDs are unique and can only be used once per page, while classes can be used multiple times on the same page.

## Question 6: What is the "float" property in CSS used for?

The "float" property in CSS is used to specify how an element should float on the page. When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document and positioned to the left or right of its container. This can be used to create multi-column layouts or to position elements next to each other.

## Question 7: What is the difference between "display:none" and "visibility:hidden" in CSS?

`display:none` removes an element from the flow of the document and hides it completely, while `visibility:hidden` hides the element but still takes up space in the document flow. This means that an element with "display:none" will not be visible and will not affect the layout of the page, while an element with "visibility:hidden" will not be visible but will still take up space in the layout.

## Question 8: What is the "z-index" property in CSS used for?

The `z-index` property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of elements on a web page. Elements with a higher "z-index" value will be displayed on top of elements with a lower value. This can be used to create overlapping effects and to position elements in front of or behind other elements.

## Question 9: What is the difference between "inline" and "block" elements in CSS?

"Inline" elements are displayed inline with the text, while "block" elements are displayed as a block-level box that takes up the full width of its container. Block-level elements start on a new line and are often used to create sections or divisions on a web page, while inline elements are used for smaller pieces of content within a block-level element.

## Question 10: What is the purpose of a CSS reset?
A CSS reset is a set of styles that override the default styles applied by browsers to HTML elements. This helps ensure consistent rendering across different browsers and reduces the need for browser-specific styles. CSS resets typically remove any margins, paddings, and other styles applied by the browser and provide a clean slate for developers to work with. Popular CSS reset frameworks include Normalize.css and Reset.css.
